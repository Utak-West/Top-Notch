# Top Notch Renovations & Home Services - Website Handover Documentation

**Date:** May 04, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the assets delivered for the Top Notch Renovations & Home Services website project and guidance for migrating these assets into a live WordPress environment hosted on GoDaddy, utilizing the Nexter Pro theme and Elementor Pro page builder.

Due to challenges encountered setting up a stable WordPress environment within the development sandbox, the website components were built as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, accompanied by content drafts and strategic documentation. This package provides the foundation for the final website.

## 3. Migration Guide: Static Build to WordPress/Elementor on GoDaddy

This section provides high-level guidance for integrating the provided static assets into a live WordPress site.

**Disclaimer:** This migration process, particularly theme integration, requires technical expertise in WordPress, Elementor, CSS, and potentially PHP. It is recommended that this process be handled by a developer familiar with these technologies.

**Prerequisites:**

*   GoDaddy hosting account with WordPress installed.
*   Nexter Pro theme installed and activated.
*   Elementor & Elementor Pro plugins installed and activated.
*   Amelia Booking plugin installed and activated.
*   Recommended supporting plugins installed (e.g., an SEO plugin like All-in-One SEO or Yoast, a caching plugin like WP Rocket, an image optimization plugin like ShortPixel or Smush).
*   Access to TypeForm account for creating the contact form.

**Steps:**

1.  **Theme Styling Integration:**
    *   **Option A (Elementor Global Styles):** Configure Elementor's Site Settings (Global Colors, Global Fonts, Theme Style) to match the design defined in `style.css` (colors, typography, button styles, etc.). This is the preferred Elementor way.
    *   **Option B (Custom CSS):** Copy relevant CSS rules from `style.css` into Elementor's Custom CSS areas (Site Settings > Custom CSS, or per-page/widget CSS) or into the WordPress Customizer (Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS).
    *   **Option C (Child Theme):** For more complex styling or structural changes, create a WordPress child theme for Nexter Pro and enqueue a custom stylesheet containing necessary rules from `style.css`.
    *   **Review Nexter Pro:** Explore Nexter Pro's specific options for integrating custom styles or code.

2.  **Page Creation & Content Migration:**
    *   Create the necessary pages in WordPress (Home, Services, About, Portfolio, Process, Contact).
    *   Edit each page using "Edit with Elementor".
    *   Replicate the structure defined in the static HTML files (`/theme/*.html`) using Elementor widgets (Sections, Columns, Headings, Text Editor, Image, Button, etc.).
    *   Manually copy the text content from the corresponding markdown files (`/content/pages/*.md`) and paste it into the appropriate Elementor Text Editor widgets.
    *   *Note on Bulk Upload:* While manual copy/paste is feasible for these pages, if future content involves large volumes (e.g., many portfolio items, blog posts), consider using WP All Import Pro (as per user preference) with appropriately formatted CSV/XML files.

3.  **Image Upload & Placement:**
    *   Optimize images locally first (resize, compress, format as WebP/JPG) as per the `performance_optimization_plan.md`.
    *   Upload images to the WordPress Media Library.
    *   Place images onto the Elementor pages using Image widgets, ensuring appropriate sizes and adding descriptive Alt Text (as per `seo_strategy.md`).

4.  **Form Integration:**
    *   **Contact/Quote Form:** Create the form in TypeForm based on `lead_capture_design.md`. Embed the TypeForm onto the Contact page using Elementor's HTML widget or a dedicated TypeForm plugin.
    *   **Consultation Booking:** Configure the "Free Initial Consultation" service in Amelia based on `lead_capture_design.md`. Embed the Amelia booking form onto the Contact page (e.g., using the `[ameliabooking]` shortcode in an Elementor Shortcode widget).

5.  **Navigation Menu:**
    *   Go to Appearance > Menus.
    *   Create a primary navigation menu, adding links to all the created pages (Home, Services, About, Portfolio, Process, Contact).
    *   Assign this menu to the primary menu location in Nexter Pro theme settings.

6.  **Header & Footer:**
    *   Use Elementor Pro's Theme Builder (or Nexter Pro's header/footer builder if available) to create the site-wide header and footer, replicating the structure from `/theme/templates/partials/` and incorporating the navigation menu.

7.  **Plugin Configuration:**
    *   **Caching:** Configure WP Rocket (or alternative) based on `performance_optimization_plan.md` (page cache, browser cache, GZIP, CSS/JS minification/deferral).
    *   **Image Optimization:** Configure ShortPixel/Smush to optimize future uploads and potentially bulk optimize existing library images.
    *   **SEO:** Configure the chosen SEO plugin (e.g., All-in-One SEO) based on `seo_strategy.md`. Set page titles/metas (can often be done directly in Elementor's page settings when an SEO plugin is active).
    *   **Analytics:** Implement Google Tag Manager snippet (using a plugin like GTM4WP or Insert Headers and Footers) and configure GA4 tags as per `traffic_analytics_plan.md`.

## 4. Lead Management & Analytics Overview

*   **Lead Workflow:** Refer to `docs/lead_management_workflow.md` for the plan to connect TypeForm and Amelia submissions to Airtable/Notion using Zapier/N8N/Make for tracking.
*   **Traffic Analytics:** Refer to `docs/traffic_analytics_plan.md` for setting up GA4 via GTM to monitor website traffic and conversions.

## 5. Ongoing Website Maintenance (Post-Launch)

Once the site is live on WordPress, regular maintenance is crucial:

*   **Updates:** Regularly update WordPress core, Nexter Pro theme, and all plugins (weekly check recommended). **Always back up before updating.**
*   **Backups:** Implement a regular backup schedule (e.g., daily or weekly) using a WordPress backup plugin (like UpdraftPlus, WPvivid) or GoDaddy's hosting backup features. Store backups off-server periodically.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Regularly check site speed using Google PageSpeed Insights and address any regressions.
*   **Security:** Ensure security measures are active (strong passwords, consider a security plugin if needed).
*   **Database Optimization:** Run database cleanup/optimization tasks periodically (e.g., monthly) using a plugin like WP-Optimize.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Support

*   **Common Issues:** Refer to the `website_testing_guide.md` for common WordPress troubleshooting steps (cache clearing, plugin conflicts).
*   **Support:** For issues related to hosting, contact GoDaddy support. For issues related to premium plugins (Elementor Pro, Nexter Pro, Amelia, WP Rocket), consult their respective support channels. For issues related to the migration or custom implementation, contact your development support provider.
