# Performance Optimization Plan for Top Notch Renovations & Home Services

**Goal:** Ensure the Top Notch Renovations & Home Services website loads quickly and provides an excellent user experience across all devices, contributing to better SEO rankings and higher conversion rates. This plan considers both the current static build phase and the eventual deployment on WordPress/GoDaddy.

## 1. Image Optimization

**Rationale:** Images are crucial for showcasing renovation work but are often the largest contributors to page weight.

*   **Action (Static Build & Deployment):**
    *   **Resize:** Manually resize all images (portfolio, hero backgrounds, etc.) to the maximum required display dimensions before uploading. (e.g., Hero: ~1920px wide, Portfolio items: ~600x400px).
    *   **Format:** Convert images to modern, efficient formats like **WebP** where possible, providing JPG/PNG fallbacks for older browsers.
    *   **Compression:** Compress all images using tools like TinyPNG/TinyJPG (online) or image editing software. Aim for a balance between file size and visual quality (e.g., 70-80% quality for JPGs).
    *   **SVG:** Use SVG format for logos and simple icons where feasible.
*   **Action (WordPress Deployment):**
    *   Implement an image optimization plugin (e.g., **ShortPixel**, **Smush Pro**) to automate resizing, compression, and WebP conversion on upload.
    *   Enable **Lazy Loading** for images below the fold (via plugin or theme settings).
    *   Ensure `width` and `height` attributes are added to `<img>` tags.

## 2. CSS & JavaScript Optimization

**Rationale:** Unoptimized code can block rendering and slow down page load times.

*   **Action (Static Build):**
    *   **Minification:** Manually minify the final `style.css` and `script.js` files before deployment using online tools or build processes.
    *   **Combine Files:** Keep CSS and JS combined into single files where practical.
    *   **Defer JS:** Place the `<script>` tag for `script.js` just before the closing `</body>` tag to avoid render-blocking.
*   **Action (WordPress Deployment):**
    *   Utilize a caching plugin (**WP Rocket** recommended, or **W3 Total Cache**) to handle CSS/JS minification and combination.
    *   Enable options to **Defer non-critical JavaScript** and **Load CSS Asynchronously / Inline Critical CSS** (often features in caching plugins or dedicated optimization plugins like Perfmatters).
    *   Use Elementor's built-in performance settings ("Improved Asset Loading").
    *   Audit and remove unused CSS/JS using plugins like **Asset CleanUp** if necessary.
    *   Minimize reliance on heavy Elementor widgets; use lightweight alternatives.

## 3. Server & Hosting Optimization (Primarily for GoDaddy Deployment)

**Rationale:** Server configuration plays a significant role in delivery speed.

*   **Action (WordPress Deployment on GoDaddy):**
    *   **Caching:**
        *   Implement **Page Caching** using WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache.
        *   Configure **Browser Caching** via `.htaccess` or caching plugin.
        *   Enable **GZIP Compression** via `.htaccess` or caching plugin.
        *   Investigate and utilize any server-level caching offered by GoDaddy.
    *   **CDN:** Enable GoDaddy's CDN or configure a third-party CDN like Cloudflare to serve assets faster globally.
    *   **PHP Version:** Ensure the hosting environment uses the latest stable PHP version (e.g., PHP 8.0+).
    *   **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3:** Ensure the server supports modern HTTP protocols for faster parallel loading.

## 4. WordPress Specific Optimization (For Deployment)

**Rationale:** WordPress itself requires optimization.

*   **Action (WordPress Deployment):**
    *   **Theme/Plugins:** Use the lightweight Nexter Pro theme. Limit the number of active plugins to essentials. Regularly review and remove unused plugins.
    *   **Database:** Schedule regular database optimization (using plugins like **WP-Optimize**) to clean up revisions, transients, and optimize tables.
    *   **Disable Unused Features:** Disable WordPress features not needed (e.g., XML-RPC if not used, Emojis).

## 5. Mobile Performance

**Rationale:** Mobile traffic is significant; performance must be excellent on smaller devices.

*   **Action (Static Build & Deployment):**
    *   Ensure CSS includes robust responsive design (@media queries) to adapt layouts effectively (already implemented in CSS).
    *   Test thoroughly on various mobile device emulators and real devices.
    *   Consider serving smaller image sizes specifically for mobile if significant savings are possible (can be complex without server-side logic or advanced JS).
*   **Action (WordPress Deployment):**
    *   Leverage image optimization plugins that support responsive images (different sizes for different viewports).
    *   Ensure caching and optimization settings are effective for mobile users.
    *   Minimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by specifying image dimensions and avoiding content injection above the fold.

## 6. Monitoring & Testing

**Rationale:** Performance is not a one-time task; ongoing monitoring is essential.

*   **Action (Post-Launch):**
    *   **Baseline Testing:** Test key pages (Home, Services, Portfolio, Contact) using:
        *   **Google PageSpeed Insights:** Aim for Mobile > 80, Desktop > 90.
        *   **GTmetrix:** Monitor Web Vitals (LCP, TBT/FID, CLS) and overall load time.
        *   **WebPageTest:** Analyze waterfall charts for bottlenecks.
    *   **Ongoing Monitoring:**
        *   Schedule regular performance tests (e.g., monthly or after significant site changes).
        *   Monitor Core Web Vitals report in Google Search Console.
        *   Analyze page load times in Google Analytics 4.

## Implementation Summary:

*   **During Static Build:** Focus on manual image optimization, clean HTML/CSS/JS, and basic code placement (defer JS).
*   **During WordPress Migration/Deployment:** Implement caching plugin (WP Rocket), image optimization plugin (ShortPixel/Smush), configure CDN, optimize database, leverage Elementor settings, and ensure latest PHP version.
*   **Post-Launch:** Establish regular testing and monitoring schedule.
