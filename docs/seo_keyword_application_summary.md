# SEO Keyword Application Summary

This document outlines how the defined SEO keyword strategy will be applied to the core website pages. This is based on the "SEO Keyword Strategy" provided in the project brief and aligns with Phase 6 of the project plan.

## Primary Target Pages & Keywords:

1.  **Homepage (`homepage_structure.html`)**

    *   **Primary Keywords to integrate naturally**:

        *   `Linden NJ home improvement` (if space and natural flow allow)
        *   `electrical contractor NJ` (secondary focus here, more on specific electrical page)
    *   **Content Areas for Keyword Integration**:
        *   Meta Title & Description
        *   H1 Tag (e.g., "Expert Home Renovations & Electrical Services in Linden, NJ")
        *   Introductory paragraphs
        *   Service overview sections (linking to specific service pages)

2.  **Service: Complete Renovations (`service_complete_renovations_structure.html`)**
    *   **Primary Focus**: General renovation services.
    *   **Primary Keywords**:
        *   `home renovation contractor in NJ`

3.  **Sub-Service: Bathroom Renovations (within `service_complete_renovations_structure.html` or as a dedicated page)**
    *   **Primary Focus**: Bathroom specific renovations.
    *   **Primary Keywords**:
        *   `bathroom renovation Linden NJ`
        *   `complete bathroom makeover Linden`
        *   `electrical contractor bathroom remodel` (emphasizing integrated service)
    *   **Secondary Keywords**:

        *   `small bathroom renovation specialist`
        *   `affordable bathroom remodel NJ`

    *   **Content Areas**: Meta Title/Description, H1/H2s, body content for kitchen services, image alt text.

5.  **Service: Electrical Services (Conceptual - would have a structure like `service_electrical_structure.html`)**
    *   **Primary Focus**: General electrical services.
    *   **Primary Keywords**:
        *   `electrical contractor Linden NJ` (or relevant locality)
        *   `NJ licensed electrician`
    *   **Sub-pages (Panel Upgrades, Lighting etc.) will have more specific terms.**

## Secondary & Local Keywords Application:

*   **Secondary Keywords** (e.g., `bathroom renovation, electrical upgrade`, `small bathroom renovation specialist`) will be used within the body content of the most relevant pages, in supporting headings (H2-H4), and in blog posts or case studies that elaborate on these specific scenarios.
*   **Local Keywords** (e.g., `Linden NJ bathroom renovation`, `Clark NJ kitchen remodeling`, `Union County Home improvement`, `NJ licensed renovation contractor`, `bonded remodeling contractor NJ`) will be:
    *   Incorporated into meta titles and descriptions where appropriate.
    *   Used in page content, especially when discussing service areas or specific local projects.
    *   Featured prominently on the Contact Us page.
    *   Used in Google Business Profile optimization.
    *   Used in local landing pages if created later.

## On-Page SEO Implementation Steps (Conceptual for Mockup):

*   **Meta Titles & Descriptions**: Each key page will have unique, keyword-optimized meta titles and descriptions.
*   **Heading Structure (H1-H6)**: Proper semantic heading structure will be used, with primary keywords in H1s and relevant secondary keywords in H2s-H4s.
*   **Content Optimization**: Keywords will be integrated naturally into the page copy.
*   **Image Alt Text**: All significant images will have descriptive alt text, incorporating keywords where relevant.
*   **Internal Linking**: Pages will be interlinked logically (e.g., homepage to service pages, service pages to relevant portfolio items or blog posts, project process page from service pages).
*   **Schema Markup**: LocalBusiness schema, Service schema, and potentially Review/FAQ schema will be planned for implementation (using the SEO plugin).

This summary provides a guide for the content writing and on-page optimization process. The actual implementation would involve using the chosen SEO plugin (e.g., Yoast SEO/Rank Math) to input these details and analyze page optimization.
