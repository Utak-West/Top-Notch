*   **Headings (H1-H6):** Use one H1 per page, incorporating the main keyword. Use H2-H6 for subheadings, naturally including secondary and related keywords.

*   **Internal Linking:** Link relevant pages together using descriptive anchor text (e.g., link from a bathroom renovation description to the main electrical services page using anchor text like "integrated electrical services").
*   **Readability:** Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and clear formatting to improve user experience.

*   **HTTPS:** Ensure the website uses HTTPS for security (standard on most hosting).
*   **URL Structure:** Use clean, simple, keyword-rich URLs (e.g., `/services/kitchen-remodeling-rahway-nj/` if creating location-specific service pages, or `/services/kitchen-remodeling/` if relying on general local signals).
*   **Schema Markup:** Implement relevant schema markup using JSON-LD:
    *   `LocalBusiness` (or more specific types like `HomeAndConstructionBusiness`, `Electrician`, `GeneralContractor`) on all pages, including NAP, hours, service area.
    *   `Service` for each distinct service offered.
    *   `Review` or `AggregateRating` to markup testimonials.
    *   `Person` for Pedro Ribeiro on the About page.
